Project Description
Called ‘Pixelmatics’, my term project is a 2D animatic application that allows users 
to create their own animatic with the guide of a music beat visualizer.In the application, 
users will be able to easily draw an animation to their chosen song. It will feature 
the traditional drawing tools needed to create an animation digitally, in addition 
to a music beat analyzing feature. This feature will allow the user to import a sound of 
their choice then view the sound wave shape of their music. Besides this key feature, 
the app will contain traditional animation application tools. For instance, it will 
incorporate an erasing feature, a color palette, and a text tool. It will also include 
a flood fill feature that allows users to easily fill in outlines. Also, users will be 
able to import images or past projects.
